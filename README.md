# Capstone
# PowerBall
We selected the Powerball project as our idea.

The reason we chose this project is because we truly believe that we can predict the outcome of the next big powerball jackpot using the skills we've learned throughout this course. If we can compile information dating the last 4 years, we can see what combinations of numbers have been picked and try to predict the next trend.

We grabbed data from the Lotto Report site. This includes powerball sales as well. The reasoning behind including ticket sales is so that we can also predict the jackpot amount.

With this project we hope to answer when our best chances will be to win the powerball jackpot.


## Communication Protocol
Our group will meet at least twice per week via Zoom to discuss the project segment due. We will use Slack to communicate in between meetings and if anyone has any questions for their portion of the project.
