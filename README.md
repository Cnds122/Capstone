## OVERVIEW

Within this project we explore the possibilities of predicting the next powerball number. Utilizing previous numbers we build a machine learning model and compare outputs with a random model. 

## Technologies Used

#### Data Cleaning
- Pandas utilized for exploratory measures along with initial cleaning
- Python is used for further analysis

#### Database
- Postgres SQL will be used to build out the database
- Database is hosted and connected via AWS

#### Machine Learning
- Classifiers created using SciKitLearn
- Random Forest Classifier model used to predict outcome
- Random model used to compare predictions

#### Dashboard
- Tableau is used to create dashboard and interactive features
- Google Slides will host our final presentation

## Communication Protocol

Project was worked on as a group during class hours two times a week. Additional zoom meeting towards the end were scheduled to ensure push requests were accurate. Most other communication was hosted via slack as needed.
